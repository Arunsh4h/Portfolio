### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Implement RBAC with granularity, allowing administrators, editors, and contributors to perform specific actions based on their role, ensuring a secure and organized workflow.

### API Integration

Integrate third-party APIs to fetch real-time data, such as product prices or availability, enriching the coupon details dynamically.

## Frontend Development with WordPress and React
